# Milestone-01

## Contains code that is the starting point for the "naming conventions" refactoring:

When running the unittests, some tests fail. It's hard to see what is going wrong because the test methods do not have meaningful names...  
We are going to introduce a naming-convention for our test methods that makes them reveal their intention.
